#Onebusaway-NYC-AtStop Product Spec Notes

##Assumptions
Hybrid apps can do everything we want with reasonable performance.

##Goals
Implement features already in the OBANYC Mobile Site (Search, Stop Selection, Stop Page, Nearby)
Make use of 2014-era (vs 2011-era) S technology.
Improve on nearby functionality
Include maps
Include an obvious favorites page.



##Some thoughts on Experience
Including buses on the route view is a lie when there are multiple patterns of service (i.e. when buses don't make every stop). This kills it for someone who is waiting on a limited bus or a bus on a "Y-Pattern."

It should perform well across a variety of devices, with a variety of screen sizes.


###On Customization
Options:
Default of search or nearby page.
Map tilesets

##Use Cases and Example Images
As a user, I want to search for nearby buses via Route, Stop ID, or Intersection
As a user, I want to see what nearby buses are approaching.
As a user, I want to be able to favorite a stop, route, or route map.
